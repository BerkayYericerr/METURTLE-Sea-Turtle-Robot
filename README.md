# Sea Turtle Protection Robot (METU-RTLE)

This is the capstone project developed as part of ESC 491 & ESC 492 courses at Middle East Technical University (METU). The project aims to assist and protect endangered sea turtle hatchlings (Caretta caretta) by using autonomous robotic technologies.

## Objective

To design and implement a GPS-guided, AI-enabled mobile robot that can detect hatchlings and guide or protect them from natural predators during their vulnerable journey to the sea.

## Key Features

- Computer Vision using YOLOv5 for hatchling detection  
- GPS-based path tracking and logging  
- Obstacle avoidance with ultrasonic sensors  
- Web dashboard for live battery and status monitoring  
- Modular and scalable embedded design

## Technologies Used

- Python, OpenCV, Flask  
- Raspberry Pi, Arduino  
- Firebase for web dashboard and data sync  
- 3D-printed robot chassis  
- Git for version control

## Team Members

This project was developed collaboratively by a multidisciplinary team including members from the Departments of Computer Engineering, Electrical-Electronics Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering at METU.
